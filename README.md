# Collecting Data Individual Project - Pan Lei
This notebook is an improved version of assignment 4. It is the analyse of one of csv file in the Tate Collection.
First I check the csv - artists_data.csv, for instance, data types, columns, and duplicates.
Then I solve two questions that I come up with while exploring the data. One is to see which country is the popular birthplace for artists and which is the deathplace. Another is are there more male artists or female artists as time goes by.
